# EPAT · Python for Algorithmic Trading · Companion Code

This repository contains the companion code for the EPAT article and slide deck
on **Python for Algorithmic Trading: Efficient Markets, Backtesting, and Streaming**.
It provides the scripts and notebooks used to illustrate concepts such as
random walks and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), vectorized and
event-based backtesting, streaming tick data, and basic causality diagnostics.

## Repository Layout

- `code/`  
  Standalone Python scripts grouped by topic:
  - EMH benchmarks and random walks.
  - Vectorized lagged-returns OLS backtests.
  - Event-based momentum backtests.
  - ZeroMQ-based streaming examples.
  - Granger-causality simulations and tests.

- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks that provide narrative, executable walk-throughs of the
  same topics, suitable for self-study and workshops.

- `figures/`  
  Placeholder directory for figures generated by the scripts and notebooks.
  Figures are not tracked here; regenerate them locally as needed.

Each script and notebook is documented with inline comments explaining the
purpose of key steps and how they relate back to the article and slides.
